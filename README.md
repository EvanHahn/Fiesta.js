Fiesta.js - version 0.1.0
=========================

**Fiesta** is a JavaScript game engine. It aims to support 2D and 3D games using modern browser technologies. It is greatly inspired by [Game Maker](http://www.yoyogames.com/make).

It is built using [JS.Class](http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/) and [browser-detect](https://github.com/rsyring/browser-detect).

It's not done yet! Everything here is subject to change.

Fiesta's goals
--------------

* Fiesta is aimed at those familiar with JavaScript and OOP.
* Fiesta should be easy to learn, read, and write.
* Fiesta should support 2D and 3D games. Switching between the two should only be a matter of changing how the game is displayed.
* Fiesta should not rely on any plugins and should work with standard browser technologies.
